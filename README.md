# task-diary

My first complete project containing an API. The website helps registered users to have more control over their lives, by enabling them to track and plan daily life activities. The Express-based server side stores user's data in a MongoDB database. The user interface has been developed using React, and Material-UI that guarantee a clean, fresh feeling.
